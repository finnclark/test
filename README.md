Hey there!

This is a site to display some of the work I have been doing over the past few years.
The work I have produced is mainly photography work but also a large portion consists of graphic design work, as that is my major.
I have been developing (pun intended) my skills as a front-end web designer for just under a year now. This site in itself is a small showcase of my coding skills.
